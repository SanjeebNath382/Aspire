## Overview
We aim at building a platform to provide employment oppourtunities to all the women accross rural areas. We focus on both the skilled as well as the unskilled sectors of employment. The website has 2 main components. First one is the Job Portal for women looking for jobs in the skilled or unskilled sectors. It provides a list of jobs from various employers posted in it, having separate login as an employer or an applicant. Women can select the jobs according to their preference of skills and location., and apply accordingly. Second Component is a buying-selling platform for the household self-employed women willing to sell their homemade objects like handicrafts, farm products, etc. The buyer can buy as much as he/she wants, add it to cart and pay for it (which would help them support their livelihoods). Lastly we tend to provide some resources and awareness about government schemes for rural women for their upliftment. We provide a one-stop solution and guide for the rural women to become self-dependant.
